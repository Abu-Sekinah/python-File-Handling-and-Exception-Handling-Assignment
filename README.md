# File Read & Write with Error Handling in Python

This Python script reads an input file, modifies its contents, and writes the modified content to a new file. It also includes error handling to gracefully deal with common issues like file not found or permission errors.

## Features

- **Read from file:** The script asks for the name of an input file and tries to read its content.
- **Modify contents:** In this example, the content is converted to uppercase. You can customize this step to apply other modifications like reversing the text, removing blank lines, etc.
- **Write to new file:** The script writes the modified content to a new file with a `modified_` prefix added to the original filename.
- **Error handling:** The script includes error handling for missing files, permission issues, and unexpected errors.

### To summarize:
- **What it does:** The script reads a file, modifies its contents (e.g., converts text to uppercase), and writes the modified content to a new file.
- **Error handling:** It handles errors like missing files and read/write permissions.
- **Customization:** Itâ€™s easy to modify the content modification part to suit different needs.
